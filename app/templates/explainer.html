                <p>Look, I'm not some fancy theoretical physicist - I'm just a guy who got really good at spotting patterns in sports betting. While everyone else was chasing parlays, I was building algorithms in my spare time. Now we've got some seriously smart code doing the heavy lifting while we chill and watch the games. It's like having a calculator that prints money. ü§ì</p>

                        where $p$ is win probability and $b$ is decimal odds. We use Quarter Kelly because I've blown up enough accounts in my testing to know better. Fun fact: this formula was originally used for phone lines, which is pretty wild considering we're using it to get paid. üìû</p>
